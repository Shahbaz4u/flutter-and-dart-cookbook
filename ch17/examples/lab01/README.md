## Overview
The beauty of the solar system example, is once you know how to display a planet, a similar approach can be used to display the others. 
To keep things simple, the example does not use sprites, so will work with dartpad.dev.
Note: This is a demo, so for simplicity some coding shortcuts apply.

Just to get you up to speed on the solar system, there are eight planets that rotate in an anticlockwise direction around the sun. 
In the demo code, a two dimensional (2d) simulation will be used to replicate the rotational orbit of the planets. 
To achieve the objective the canvas object will be used to map our objects into a 2d setting.

## Example
In this example build a model solar System where you will:

* Use the basics of the Flame game engine
* Understand how to use Canvas tools to draw shapes such as a circle
* Translate an object in two dimensional space
* Rotate an object about an axis
* Add Canvas text to an onscreen object
